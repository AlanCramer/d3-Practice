Experiments with D3. 

Playfair: Okay, with D3 its easy to create some sort of graphic. But how hard is it to create something that is tightly specified? As an experiment, I started recreating the "first line chart" by William Playfair. The image I was after is in the repo. 


Female Participation in Labor Force: From Gapminder, some facinating data about the percentage of women working, per country. What happened in 1990?
